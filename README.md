# nAmez

A simple app that generates random startup/band/whatever names. Generates UpperCamelCased names in pairs of 2.

Lets you save your favourites in a new screen.

(Doesn't actually save your data outside the local session. First mobile app okay.)

**Download the Android APK [here](https://appho.st/d/#/H8M967SD).**

**Download the iOS IPA nowhere because I don't have a Mac so I can't compile lmao. Also no one's going to manually install this terrible app because Apple is a Hassle**
